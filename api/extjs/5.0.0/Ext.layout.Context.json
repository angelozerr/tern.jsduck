Most methods in\n<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout\" rel=\"Ext.layout.Layout\" class=\"docClass\">Layout</a> are called during a read phase:\n<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate\" rel=\"Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate\" class=\"docClass\">calculate</a>,\n<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-completeLayout\" rel=\"Ext.layout.Layout-method-completeLayout\" class=\"docClass\">completeLayout</a> and\n<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-finalizeLayout\" rel=\"Ext.layout.Layout-method-finalizeLayout\" class=\"docClass\">finalizeLayout</a>. The exceptions to this are\n<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-beginLayout\" rel=\"Ext.layout.Layout-method-beginLayout\" class=\"docClass\">beginLayout</a>,\n<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-beginLayoutCycle\" rel=\"Ext.layout.Layout-method-beginLayoutCycle\" class=\"docClass\">beginLayoutCycle</a> and\n<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-finishedLayout\" rel=\"Ext.layout.Layout-method-finishedLayout\" class=\"docClass\">finishedLayout</a> which are called during\na write phase. While <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-finishedLayout\" rel=\"Ext.layout.Layout-method-finishedLayout\" class=\"docClass\">finishedLayout</a> is called\na write phase, it is really intended to be a catch-all for post-processing after a\nlayout run.</p>\n\n<p>In a read phase, it is OK to read the DOM but this should be done using the appropriate\n<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem\" rel=\"Ext.layout.ContextItem\" class=\"docClass\">ContextItem</a> where possible since that provides a cache\nto avoid redundant reads. No writes should be made to the DOM in a read phase! Instead,\nthe values should be written to the proper ContextItem for later write-back.</p>\n\n<p>The rules flip-flop in a write phase. The only difference is that ContextItem methods\nlike <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getStyle\" rel=\"Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getStyle\" class=\"docClass\">getStyle</a> will still read the DOM unless the\nvalue was previously read. This detail is unknowable from the outside of ContextItem, so\nread calls to ContextItem should also be avoided in a write phase.</p>\n\n<p>Calculating interdependent layouts requires a certain amount of iteration. In a given\ncycle, some layouts will contribute results that allow other layouts to proceed. The\ngeneral flow then is to gather all of the layouts (both component and container) in a\ncomponent tree and queue them all for processing. The initial queue order is bottom-up\nand component layout first, then container layout (if applicable) for each component.</p>\n\n<p>This initial step also calls the beginLayout method on all layouts to clear any values\nfrom the DOM that might interfere with calculations and measurements. In other words,\nthis is a \"write phase\" and reads from the DOM should be strictly avoided.</p>\n\n<p>Next the layout enters into its iterations or \"cycles\". Each cycle consists of calling\nthe <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate\" rel=\"Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate\" class=\"docClass\">calculate</a> method on all layouts in the\n<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.Context-property-layoutQueue\" rel=\"Ext.layout.Context-property-layoutQueue\" class=\"docClass\">layoutQueue</a>. These calls are part of a \"read phase\" and writes to the DOM should\nbe strictly avoided.</p>\n\n<h1>Considerations</h1>\n\n<p><strong>RULE 1</strong>: Respect the read/write cycles. Always use the <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getProp\" rel=\"Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getProp\" class=\"docClass\">getProp</a>\nor <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getDomProp\" rel=\"Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getDomProp\" class=\"docClass\">getDomProp</a> methods to get calculated values;\nonly use the <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getStyle\" rel=\"Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getStyle\" class=\"docClass\">getStyle</a> method to read styles; use\n<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-setProp\" rel=\"Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-setProp\" class=\"docClass\">setProp</a> to set DOM values. Some reads will, of\ncourse, still go directly to the DOM, but if there is a method in\n<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem\" rel=\"Ext.layout.ContextItem\" class=\"docClass\">ContextItem</a> to do a certain job, it should be used instead\nof a lower-level equivalent.</p>\n\n<p>The basic logic flow in <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate\" rel=\"Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate\" class=\"docClass\">calculate</a> consists of gathering\nvalues by calling <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getProp\" rel=\"Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getProp\" class=\"docClass\">getProp</a> or\n<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getDomProp\" rel=\"Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getDomProp\" class=\"docClass\">getDomProp</a>, calculating results and publishing\nthem by calling <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-setProp\" rel=\"Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-setProp\" class=\"docClass\">setProp</a>. It is important to realize\nthat <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getProp\" rel=\"Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getProp\" class=\"docClass\">getProp</a> will return <code>undefined</code> if the value\nis not yet known. But the act of calling the method is enough to track the fact that the\ncalling layout depends (in some way) on this value. In other words, the calling layout is\n\"triggered\" by the properties it requests.</p>\n\n<p><strong>RULE 2</strong>: Avoid calling <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getProp\" rel=\"Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getProp\" class=\"docClass\">getProp</a> unless the value\nis needed. Gratuitous calls cause inefficiency because the layout will appear to depend on\nvalues that it never actually uses. This applies equally to\n<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getDomProp\" rel=\"Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getDomProp\" class=\"docClass\">getDomProp</a> and the test-only methods\n<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-hasProp\" rel=\"Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-hasProp\" class=\"docClass\">hasProp</a> and <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-hasDomProp\" rel=\"Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-hasDomProp\" class=\"docClass\">hasDomProp</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Because <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getProp\" rel=\"Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-getProp\" class=\"docClass\">getProp</a> can return <code>undefined</code>, it is often\nthe case that subsequent math will produce NaN's. This is usually not a problem as the\nNaN's simply propagate along and result in final results that are NaN. Both <code>undefined</code>\nand NaN are ignored by <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-setProp\" rel=\"Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-setProp\" class=\"docClass\">Ext.layout.ContextItem.setProp</a>, so it is often not necessary\nto even know that this is happening. It does become important for determining if a layout\nis not done or if it might lead to publishing an incorrect (but not NaN or <code>undefined</code>)\nvalue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>RULE 3</strong>: If a layout has not calculated all the values it is required to calculate, it\nmust set <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-property-done\" rel=\"Ext.layout.Layout-property-done\" class=\"docClass\">done</a> to <code>false</code> before returning from\n<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate\" rel=\"Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate\" class=\"docClass\">calculate</a>. This value is always <code>true</code> on entry because\nit is simpler to detect the incomplete state rather than the complete state (especially up\nand down a class hierarchy).</p>\n\n<p><strong>RULE 4</strong>: A layout must never publish an incomplete (wrong) result. Doing so would cause\ndependent layouts to run their calculations on those wrong values, producing more wrong\nvalues and some layouts may even incorrectly flag themselves as <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-property-done\" rel=\"Ext.layout.Layout-property-done\" class=\"docClass\">done</a>\nbefore the correct values are determined and republished. Doing this will poison the\ncalculations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>RULE 5</strong>: Each value should only be published by one layout. If multiple layouts attempt\nto publish the same values, it would be nearly impossible to avoid breaking <strong>RULE 4</strong>. To\nhelp detect this problem, the layout diagnostics will trap on an attempt to set a value\nfrom different layouts.</p>\n\n<p>Complex layouts can produce many results as part of their calculations. These values are\nimportant for other layouts to proceed and need to be published by the earliest possible\ncall to <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate\" rel=\"Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate\" class=\"docClass\">Ext.layout.Layout.calculate</a> to avoid unnecessary cycles and poor performance. It is\nalso possible, however, for some results to be related in a way such that publishing them\nmay be an all-or-none proposition (typically to avoid breaking <em>RULE 4</em>).</p>\n\n<p><strong>RULE 6</strong>: Publish results as soon as they are known to be correct rather than wait for\nall values to be calculated. Waiting for everything to be complete can lead to deadlock.\nThe key here is not to forget <strong>RULE 4</strong> in the process.</p>\n\n<p>Some layouts depend on certain critical values as part of their calculations. For example,\nHBox depends on width and cannot do anything until the width is known. In these cases, it\nis best to use <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-block\" rel=\"Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-block\" class=\"docClass\">block</a> or\n<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-domBlock\" rel=\"Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-domBlock\" class=\"docClass\">domBlock</a> and thereby avoid processing the layout\nuntil the needed value is available.</p>\n\n<p><strong>RULE 7</strong>: Use <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-block\" rel=\"Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-block\" class=\"docClass\">block</a> or\n<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-domBlock\" rel=\"Ext.layout.ContextItem-method-domBlock\" class=\"docClass\">domBlock</a> when values are required to make progress.\nThis will mimize wasted recalculations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>RULE 8</strong>: Blocks should only be used when no forward progress can be made. If even one\nvalue could still be calculated, a block could result in a deadlock.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, layouts have been invoked directly by component code, sometimes in places\nlike an <code>afterLayout</code> method for a child component. With the flexibility now available\nto solve complex, iterative issues, such things should be done in a responsible layout\n(be it component or container).</p>\n\n<p><strong>RULE 9</strong>: Use layouts to solve layout issues and don't wait for the layout to finish to\nperform further layouts. This is especially important now that layouts process entire\ncomponent trees and not each layout in isolation.</p>\n\n<h1>Sequence Diagram</h1>\n\n<p>The simplest sequence diagram for a layout run looks roughly like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  Context         Layout 1     Item 1     Layout 2     Item 2\n     |               |           |           |           |\n----&gt;X--------------&gt;X           |           |           |\nrun  X---------------|-----------|----------&gt;X           |\n     X beginLayout   |           |           |           |\n     X               |           |           |           |\n   A X--------------&gt;X           |           |           |\n     X  calculate    X----------&gt;X           |           |\n     X             C X  getProp  |           |           |\n   B X               X----------&gt;X           |           |\n     X               |  setProp  |           |           |\n     X               |           |           |           |\n   D X---------------|-----------|----------&gt;X           |\n     X  calculate    |           |           X----------&gt;X\n     X               |           |           |  setProp  |\n   E X               |           |           |           |\n     X---------------|-----------|----------&gt;X           |\n     X completeLayout|           |         F |           |\n     X               |           |           |           |\n   G X               |           |           |           |\n   H X--------------&gt;X           |           |           |\n     X  calculate    X----------&gt;X           |           |\n     X             I X  getProp  |           |           |\n     X               X----------&gt;X           |           |\n     X               |  setProp  |           |           |\n   J X--------------&gt;X           |           |           |\n     X completeLayout|           |           |           |\n     X               |           |           |           |\n   K X--------------&gt;X           |           |           |\n     X---------------|-----------|----------&gt;X           |\n     X finalizeLayout|           |           |           |\n     X               |           |           |           |\n   L X--------------&gt;X           |           |           |\n     X---------------|-----------|----------&gt;X           |\n     X finishedLayout|           |           |           |\n     X               |           |           |           |\n   M X--------------&gt;X           |           |           |\n     X---------------|-----------|----------&gt;X           |\n     X notifyOwner   |           |           |           |\n   N |               |           |           |           |\n     -               -           -           -           -\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notes:</p>\n\n<p><strong>A.</strong> This is a call from the <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.Context-method-run\" rel=\"Ext.layout.Context-method-run\" class=\"docClass\">run</a> method to the <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.Context-method-runCycle\" rel=\"Ext.layout.Context-method-runCycle\" class=\"docClass\">runCycle</a> method.\nEach layout in the queue will have its <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate\" rel=\"Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate\" class=\"docClass\">calculate</a>\nmethod called.</p>\n\n<p><strong>B.</strong> After each <a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate\" rel=\"Ext.layout.Layout-method-calculate\" class=\"docClass\">calculate</a> method is called the\n<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-property-done\" rel=\"Ext.layout.Layout-property-done\" class=\"docClass\">done</a> flag is checked to see if the Layout has completed.\nIf it has completed and that layout object implements a\n<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.layout.Layout-method-completeLayout\" rel=\"Ext.layout.Layout-method-completeLayout\" class=\"docClass\">completeLayout</a> method, this layout is queued to\nreceive its call.

In some cases, this\nis as simple as a component's container layout providing results used by its component\nlayout or vise-versa.
